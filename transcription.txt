0.0 - 5.5600000000000005:  And we're going to the cube pod episode 105 John Furrier at Dave Vellante salute in the same state Dave6.0 - 12.3:  So John you're just up the street. I mean Weston come on in to come into the studio brother12.3 - 19.42:  I'm tired from New York. Andy Jassy stopped by the cube yesterday. He was in the building. CEO of19.42 - 27.5:  8 to Amazon. I was gonna say AWS. He had his folks with him. I met the parents and Lana was there.27.5 - 30.82:  his wife was his family affair sitting down with his wife30.82 - 35.34:  Kramer in the queue. He's a chat. Dude, dude, you're looking35.34 - 40.22:  good. You're looking tan. I'm shiny. I got some anti shine on40.22 - 49.14:  here. It was 102 degrees on one day 107 on the other in the big Apple. Yeah, I was driving49.14 - 55.5:  down the other day. It was 107 when I was sitting in traffic on the FDR. It was it was55.5 - 61.34:  hot. Hot Week in New York and the studio is looking good. We had a bunch of interviews.61.34 - 63.66:  It's great to see you down there. Yeah, it's great to be here.63.660000000000004 - 68.06:  It's been a bunch of hits in getting operational.68.06 - 72.38000000000001:  Brian Bauman, it's debut on the NYSE live TV show this morning72.38000000000001 - 76.06:  with Kristen Kirsten and was great76.06 - 77.5:  and pumping up wired.77.5 - 81.5:  We're going to the RAISE conference in Paris next week.81.5 - 86.66:  just a lot of action going on in the tech community.86.66 - 91.02:  AI is continuing to create such a transformative.91.02 - 95.38:  In fact, Jassy said yesterday to Jim Kramer95.38 - 97.82:  on his segment on Mad Money,97.82000000000001 - 103.42:  and as well as, you know, the one-on-one we had at theCUBE in our new studio there,103.42 - 107.5:  which by the way, he said he's definitely going to do a video there, so he pumped it to, he was107.5 - 111.58:  totally impressed with the setup. He loved the location and it's going to come on and do.111.58 - 118.3:  Next time he's adding mad money, he's going to come by the cube. The action in New York, Dave,118.3 - 125.3:  as you saw is with the wired community growing so fast from NYSC and theCUBE's collaboration,125.3 - 131.46:  you know, theCUBE and the NYSC, you know, is wired, Brian Bauman, the founder, putting131.46 - 137.62:  together, driving that franchise of digital culture, is just creating such an attraction137.62 - 143.3:  for the leaders in the industry to come in. And of course, the CUBE alumni with our 15,000143.86 - 148.98000000000002:  members or alumni that we've interviewed over the past 16 years, just the combination of the148.98 - 153.98:  the NYSE Wall Street crowd from financial analyst to media154.57999999999998 - 158.7:  is converging with the cubes, enterprise, cloud,158.7 - 162.5:  data center, AP, AI community, data community,162.5 - 166.14:  just really there's a huge overlap and connection166.14 - 167.5:  between the two communities.167.5 - 172.58:  And so it's been seeing the activity really significantly increase.172.58 - 174.3:  So it's been quite a ride.174.3 - 180.38:  And again, Andy, Jesse, coming in, their stock is almost at an all-time high,180.38 - 181.94:  but it dipped a little bit.181.94 - 190.54:  I didn't check what it was today, but clearly, they have a lot of headroom and the internal190.54 - 197.2:  scuttle, but this is from sources inside Amazon, tell me that there's tons of headroom on top197.2 - 198.2:  of it.198.2 - 199.2:  So we'll see.199.20000000000002 - 205.36:  Did you see the robotics, do you see they have more robots than humans now in the warehouses?205.36 - 212.64000000000001:  Yeah, I mean, it's indeed that article. Humanoids. They have a humanoid. So not still primitive,212.64000000000001 - 218.24:  as he said, but you know, it's coming and the robotics content we just did Palo Alto.218.24 - 226.54000000000002:  So it was that series, the AI robotics leaders is still popping on the network.226.54000000000002 - 229.5:  So it's really been an amazing ride.229.5 - 235.10000000000002:  So I want to mention a couple of things about, so a few weeks ago, was it two or three weeks235.1 - 240.46:  ago now. We had the AI robotics leaders. And so you did amazing job there. I learned a lot.241.82 - 246.94:  You know, we had a full spectrum. We had on one side of the argument was we're going to have246.94 - 253.35999999999999:  have general purpose robots, like humanoid robots, that are going to be under $50,000,253.35999999999999 - 258.6:  think $49,999, and they're going to be general robots that can do anything.258.6 - 262.0:  And then the other end of the spectrum was, no, that's not the right way to go.262.0 - 266.56:  We're going to have highly specialized robots, a robot that does your laundry, a robot that266.56 - 271.12:  does your cooking, a robot that moves your lawn, and they're going to be sub $1,500 each.272.72 - 278.0:  I like that model because I think it has a higher probability of success than a general purpose278.0 - 283.92:  model, which does a lot of things, 75%. So that was kind of one thing. The second thing is the283.92 - 289.76:  crypto trailblazers last week was picking up on, I think this is the second crypto trailblazers289.76 - 297.0:  we've done. I tell you, dude, the stablecoins are exploding. You saw a circle is now applying297.0 - 305.56:  to be basically a certified, essentially a certified entity, and you're seeing these305.56 - 311.72:  stablecoins are backed by high-quality banks and real-world assets, and that's going to311.72 - 317.0:  be a really interesting dynamic to play out. You've seen what Circle Stock has done. You've317.0 - 320.24:  We've learned quite a bit about this in the last six months or so, and of course, you've320.24 - 325.28:  been following crypto and stablecoins for years, but it's really starting to provide critical325.28 - 331.08:  infrastructure now for the banking community, and I'm predicting that you're going to start331.08 - 337.71999999999997:  to see central bank digital currencies start to be fused together in a digital world and337.71999999999997 - 343.88:  real-world assets becoming digitized and tokenized, and we're entering it. It's an entirely new,343.88 - 348.84:  really exciting era where these assets become much more fungible, much more tradable,348.84000000000003 - 357.00000000000006:  and is a much more facile environment to trade these assets. It's going to be amazing.357.56000000000006 - 362.84000000000003:  I mean, stable coins are going to change the global financial system as we know it as digital363.40000000000003 - 371.56000000000006:  currency becomes more programmable. The systems we covered this week, some interviews this week,371.56 - 377.32:  We're very much along the same lines where the crypto market is moving into what it was supposed377.32 - 383.88:  to be before the whole scams took over. But blockchain and decentralized infrastructure384.52 - 389.32:  is going to now go back to its roots where you're starting to see infrastructure.389.32 - 395.56:  And, you know, the international settlement market, stablecoins will play there.395.56 - 402.1:  And then this will be a sovereignty opportunity and everything that was built, you know, pre402.1 - 404.28:  I call old sovereignty models.404.28000000000003 - 407.8:  And we saw that with the rise of the GDPRs of the world407.8 - 409.36:  and the cloud world.409.36 - 412.84000000000003:  You're going to see the financial infrastructure change412.84000000000003 - 415.72:  because you got banks and money.415.72 - 417.12:  They're two different things, right?417.12 - 420.56:  So physical and digital coming together with AI,420.56 - 424.12:  we're seeing it in the AI factories that we cover.424.12 - 425.76:  Now that's going to replicate itself425.76 - 432.68:  into a series of decentralized, diversified payment systems.432.68 - 437.76:  And goods that are digital, which is everything,437.76 - 441.28:  needs to have a system and the system isn't built for that.441.28 - 444.03999999999996:  So I think there's a huge case study444.03999999999996 - 447.84:  in the next two years as this transformation explodes447.84 - 452.52:  because the value creation and extraction of digital452.52 - 453.92:  is just scratching the surface.453.92 - 457.72:  I think AI is going to be even as Andy Jassy said to me457.72 - 461.72:  and personally yesterday and also to Crain Run his show,461.72 - 462.84000000000003:  AI is going to be the most,462.84000000000003 - 464.68:  he more transformative than even cloud.464.68 - 466.88:  And for Jassy to say that, that's huge466.88 - 468.28:  because he's all cloud, right?468.28 - 472.68:  So for him to say that, it's AI is the next cloud wave,472.68 - 476.46:  the next kind of big surge, and it's software.476.46 - 478.76:  So you apply that same principle to money,479.68 - 481.32:  you gotta have infrastructure, right?481.32 - 488.24:  So you and I have been riffing a lot about this around stablecoins, the value of media,488.24 - 498.64:  the value of currency, and then what's going to unify all these protocols, smart contracts.498.64 - 500.71999999999997:  Right now, we're living in a world of digital islands, right?500.71999999999997 - 506.7:  They're all like siloed, you use the word stovepipes, it's a tech problem, meets money.506.7 - 511.82:  And I think it's going to be a great opportunity for entrepreneurs and innovators who see this511.82 - 516.06:  opportunity to link these currencies together, because there's going to be multiple stable516.06 - 517.06:  coins.517.06 - 524.14:  It just can't be one, maybe they said US settles on one.524.14 - 529.6999999999999:  It may not be circle, it may be something else, but what about when you leave the United States?529.6999999999999 - 534.02:  I mean, these are all questions I have, but you know, this is going to be figured out.534.02 - 535.02:  So we'll see.535.02 - 538.02:  I mean, I think it's a great opportunity.538.02 - 540.86:  And I think the buzz in New York specifically,540.86 - 544.46:  that's where the central money systems thinking capital,544.46 - 547.26:  the center of capitalism is like at the stock exchange,547.26 - 548.66:  I mean, you see it every day.548.66 - 550.56:  It's like, you know, the Wall Street guys, right?550.56 - 553.46:  You know, you know, the tech guys in Silicon Valley.553.46 - 556.9399999999999:  You know, they're merging, they're merging556.9399999999999 - 558.62:  and the culture is emerging.558.62 - 560.24:  So it's gonna be very interesting to see560.24 - 564.34:  when you blend a tech person with a finance person.564.34 - 566.38:  What does that look like with the output?568.3 - 570.14:  You cross those two personas.570.14 - 575.14:  What do you get, you know, a mercenary or a missionary?575.14 - 580.54:  I mean, there's an article today in Wired about Zuckerberg fighting with OpenAI, and580.54 - 587.8199999999999:  I think the headline on Wired Magazine is, you know, Sam Altman sent the memo to staff,587.8199999999999 - 591.06:  missionaries beat mercenaries.591.0600000000001 - 596.82:  he's basically calling meta mercenaries, Zuckerberg offering people literally $100 million in596.82 - 604.9000000000001:  the first year and $300 million over three years. You get a massive money system happening, Dave.604.9 - 609.38:  I mean, it's like mind blowing. I mean, forget about the tech stuff about robotics. I mean,609.38 - 613.86:  AI is all mind blowing. It's just mind blowing market right now. There's a lot of meat on the613.86 - 616.1:  bone, as they say, as we say.616.1 - 623.54:  So there's a lot of talk recently with the stock market hitting new highs about the parallels623.54 - 630.3000000000001:  and differences between the .com and today's, I heard Kathy Wood on TV this morning saying,630.3000000000001 - 632.6:  Yeah, we're talking about the similarities,632.6 - 634.2600000000001:  but it's nothing like that.634.2600000000001 - 637.5600000000001:  I think the truth is there are a lot of similarities.637.5600000000001 - 640.6400000000001:  Certainly the hype of people, you know,640.6400000000001 - 643.44:  companies spending money with other companies,643.44 - 647.9200000000001:  the CAPX funding, NVIDIA, kind of that very small world,647.9200000000001 - 650.6400000000001:  even though the AI trade seems to be broadening.650.6400000000001 - 652.0400000000001:  But there are a lot of differences too.652.0400000000001 - 655.8800000000001:  The companies that are funding this thing are much more stable.655.8800000000001 - 658.8000000000001:  They have much more consistent cash flows658.8000000000001 - 663.2600000000001:  than what we saw with the global crossings and the Enrons and some of the other ones663.2600000000001 - 669.1800000000001:  that were building out all the internet infrastructure, the MCIs and WorldComps.669.1800000000001 - 671.5000000000001:  But I would say this, one of the things, so a couple of things.671.5 - 674.62:  is, Kathy Wood said something that's really interesting. By the way,674.62 - 678.46:  our ARK Invest Fund is now back the year-to-date highs. She was getting678.46 - 683.1:  crushed. Of course, Tesla's way down today and she's a big Tesla bull. But683.1 - 689.3000000000001:  But one of the things she said is that they do real research, and their research, I loved689.3000000000001 - 692.3000000000001:  this, is based upon Wright's Law.692.3000000000001 - 699.5:  You heard me talking about with Floyer, Wright's Law for years, and of course the interviewer699.5 - 701.58:  or it was some CNBC person.701.58 - 702.82:  They just skipped right over it.702.82 - 704.38:  They didn't ask, what is rights law?704.38 - 705.22:  How is that?705.22 - 707.02:  They just had zero interest in it.707.02 - 709.9:  But essentially, rights law in manufacturing says709.9 - 713.14:  that as you double the cumulative volume of your output,713.14 - 716.4599999999999:  your cost decline by some constant.716.4599999999999 - 719.42:  And when you start to think about exponential growth,719.42 - 722.02:  your volumes can double very, very rapidly.722.02 - 724.42:  And we're seeing that with the likes of,724.42 - 728.76:  We saw that with arm, seen that with NVIDIA, we saw that in reverse, our rights law was728.76 - 730.9:  just crushing intel.730.9 - 736.54:  And so I thought that was very interesting that she was talking about that.736.54 - 743.66:  And then I think the other thing is the similarities here with the dot com is you saw this amazing743.66 - 747.86:  hype and these numbers that were thrown around that look ridiculous.747.86 - 752.0999999999999:  And then at some point it's, you know, as we all know there's going to be a top and something's752.1 - 756.38:  going to happen where things blow up, and then it's going to crash, and then it's going756.38 - 760.94:  to come back, my prediction, as it always happens with these waves, it comes back and760.94 - 768.0600000000001:  And makes these early numbers, half a trillion in Abilene, Texas, and trillions of dollars768.0600000000001 - 770.62:  of investment coming out of the UAE.770.62 - 775.1400000000001:  You look back and it's going to make those numbers look like tiny compared to what the775.1400000000001 - 777.34:  potential is for economic growth.777.34 - 785.22:  And the last thing I'll say is I really do think that AI is going to be a productivity785.22 - 786.22:  increase.786.22 - 788.9:  We're going to see that productivity boost.788.9 - 792.22:  At some point, it's going to show up in the numbers.792.22 - 797.9:  And I think it's going to drop down to EPS, and I think, yes, I think the market is at797.9 - 801.84:  some point going to be overvalued and the bubble will pop, but I think it will, you801.84 - 807.52:  over a 10-year plus horizon come back much, much higher than people realize and even expect.808.32 - 813.2800000000001:  I mean, the IPO market's starting to heat up. You're starting to see that Trump814.08 - 817.9200000000001:  setback. We cover that in April. Remember, when we had that liberation day,817.9200000000001 - 826.82:  and then marketing kind of went cold. Figma filed for IPO today on the NYSC.826.82 - 830.8800000000001:  So that's going to be another one. I hear that everyone's planning for Q1.830.8800000000001 - 837.1200000000001:  Did you see the Senate passed the big beautiful bill? They had to break837.12 - 841.6:  out JD Vance to break the tie. That's the way it goes these days. You know, it's either841.6 - 847.28:  Kamala or JD breaking the tie because there is no bipartisanship, but that, to the extent847.28 - 850.88:  that it survives the house is going to be stimulative.850.88 - 856.9599999999999:  And I think the Fed is going to cut, you know, the Fed's going to eventually have to cut856.9599999999999 - 857.9599999999999:  here.857.9599999999999 - 862.16:  I mean, that they will, and that's going to be stimulative.862.16 - 867.92:  So that bill, they voted 99 to want to remove the provision that would have barred states867.92 - 868.92:  from regulating AI.868.92 - 876.1999999999999:  That was a big, big, big vote of no confidence.876.1999999999999 - 879.28:  So yeah, that's politics.879.28 - 884.24:  the politics I think is sorting itself out. Again, that's good for the market. I mean,884.24 - 890.9599999999999:  I think once rational people get their arms around what's happening, and if you kick in890.96 - 897.24:  White's law, you just mentioned in the productivity gains from AI, this is going to be interesting897.24 - 903.88:  to see how the states regulate AI because a lot of these sovereignty issues are around903.88 - 904.88:  states.904.88 - 909.08:  I did an interview this week with Dave DeWalt.909.08 - 910.34:  He talked to me on theCUBE.910.34 - 914.98:  He was talking about essentially talking to me914.98 - 917.5400000000001:  about how the Iron Dome in Israel,917.5400000000001 - 920.38:  the US is looking to build domes around cities for drones,920.38 - 921.9000000000001:  protect them from drones.921.9 - 925.6999999999999:  So can you imagine Manhattan with a dome around it?925.6999999999999 - 928.18:  So you're gonna have all these AI928.18 - 929.98:  and then if AI doesn't work state to state,929.98 - 931.6999999999999:  you're gonna have, again, fragmentation933.22 - 938.22:  as robots move across lines and the map, right?938.22 - 942.78:  right so it's it's gonna be very interesting to see how that all plays out942.78 - 947.36:  I mean it's gonna be crazy and just to put a finer point on that I mean we we947.36 - 951.86:  all know about Intel's troubles we've talked about this ad nauseam but this951.86 - 957.1800000000001:  This weekend, I had a lawyer special, a lawyer came in, he did his magic, and we did actually957.1800000000001 - 958.1800000000001:  look back at Intel.958.1800000000001 - 961.1800000000001:  I don't know if you had a chance to read what we wrote.961.1800000000001 - 968.3000000000001:  And basically, looking forward at LipBoutan's plan, and we had Diane Bryant on a couple968.3000000000001 - 974.5400000000001:  weeks ago, she pointed out that when she ran the data center business at Intel, they had974.5400000000001 - 978.1400000000001:  99% of the data center market.978.14 - 981.06:  And let me just share a stat with you.981.06 - 990.3:  You remember the, I call it a dead cat bounce of 2020 for PCs and x86, but between 2020990.3 - 994.14:  and 2024, check this out, this is stark.994.14 - 1004.66:  share of the data center processor market dropped from 73% of revenue to just 11% to1004.66 - 1009.6999999999999:  last year, but basically 10% of the market was Intel.1009.6999999999999 - 1014.5:  Five years ago, four years prior to that, they had 73%.1014.5 - 1018.94:  That is a complete bit flip in the architecture of systems.1018.94 - 1023.78:  We're gone from scalar to parallel, like literally overnight.1023.78 - 1028.42:  And that underscores the fast change that we're in.1028.42 - 1033.02:  I mean, that's faster than, I mean, the internet was all like, you know, smoke and mirrors,1033.02 - 1038.0600000000002:  like, oh, it's a paradigm shift, you know, and pets.com, you know, but eventually it1038.06 - 1040.62:  It did happen, but it didn't happen that fast.1040.62 - 1045.62:  This is real actual CAPX being deployed by companies1046.58 - 1048.7:  that have incredible cash flows1048.7 - 1051.3799999999999:  and have unbelievable profitability.1051.3799999999999 - 1054.4199999999998:  I heard of one analyst today and it was really1054.42 - 1056.14:  actually pointed out, if you see if I can remember it.1056.14 - 1058.66:  We've had like five disappointments, right?1058.66 - 1063.46:  We had COVID, we had inflation, we had war,1063.46 - 1067.9:  we had tariffs, we had, you know, something else or Iran.1067.9 - 1074.26:  We had all this stuff and the earnings keep growing, cash flow keeps growing.1074.26 - 1079.6200000000001:  And so these companies are just pumping out cash and they're pouring it into this aitrate.1079.6200000000001 - 1081.9:  At some point it's got to pay back.1081.9 - 1085.92:  I think a lot of people are, some minority are thinking, all right, the whole thing's1085.92 - 1087.1200000000001:  going to blow up.1087.1200000000001 - 1092.5:  I, for one, don't think it's going to blow up in the sense that it's not going to pay1092.5 - 1094.14:  off like tulips.1094.14 - 1099.14:  I do think the market may well top and something will happen and there'll be a buying opportunity,1099.14 - 1103.38:  but I think that the productivity boost is going to be substantial and I think it's going1103.38 - 1108.66:  have last the better part of a decade, which, by the way, it hasn't done, except for twice1108.66 - 1117.0600000000002:  in our recent modern history, post-World War II, which is 1960s and 1990s.1117.06 - 1122.78:  Those were the two sustained periods of productivity increases, and I think it's going to happen1122.78 - 1123.78:  again.1123.78 - 1129.8999999999999:  I mean, I think the AI race is on for one, if you have the most GPU's, in theory, if1129.9 - 1136.38:  everything's going to be accessible via data, the most GPUs, the more supercomputing power you have,1136.94 - 1142.5400000000002:  the more applications of AI into the business, you'll be the leader. So I think, you know, it's not1142.54 - 1150.3:  not just like a sector, it's every industry, every company category in the aggregate numbers1150.3 - 1157.22:  will be impacted. So I think unlike any other bubble, there's definitely a clear line of1157.22 - 1165.78:  a site to a path to victory, if you are AI-ifying your business, if you have that customer use1165.78 - 1168.6200000000001:  case nail down or productivity use case nail down.1168.6200000000001 - 1173.58:  So I think there's two camps of AI, right, there's builders of AI and consumers of AI.1173.58 - 1178.6999999999998:  I think on both fronts is a picks and shovels market and there's also the application side.1178.6999999999998 - 1182.6599999999999:  I think applying AI will be the use case.1182.6599999999999 - 1186.22:  I think that's where the stockpile of GP user piling up.1186.22 - 1188.1000000000001:  That's why Intel's share, I believe is dropping,1188.1000000000001 - 1191.3:  because architecture changed, parallel, horizontal,1191.3 - 1194.82:  whatever you wanna call it, process, processing power,1194.82 - 1197.78:  data processing is key, right?1197.78 - 1199.9:  So okay, whatever vertical you're in,1199.9 - 1206.98:  If you're in news and media and research like we are, there's an extinction event on the1206.98 - 1207.98:  horizon.1207.98 - 1213.0600000000002:  If you don't leverage AI with the human in the loop, so the question is, what's that1213.06 - 1215.22:  look like from a dollar standpoint,1215.22 - 1221.22:  independent of the job losses or the job changes.1221.22 - 1225.06:  The money is still going to go somewhere.1225.06 - 1230.3799999999999:  It actually might lower the costs if that's the case,1230.3799999999999 - 1232.02:  or create new services.1232.02 - 1232.86:  We don't know.1232.8600000000001 - 1239.98:  all I know is this. The job creation, value creation will be big. The question is, at1239.98 - 1247.22:  the cost of jobs or at the cost of some capital, cost of capital. So, who knows? I mean, who1247.22 - 1252.5:  knows how it's going to play out all out there right now is that it's clear to us you know with1252.5 - 1259.22:  our business that AI will be play a big role in doing a lot of the operational things that were1259.22 - 1262.98:  more manual or quite frankly workflows that are competitive advantage.1263.6200000000001 - 1265.54:  And I think every company will face this.1267.3 - 1271.38:  You're right to say who knows, we don't know, but you can lay out some scenarios.1271.38 - 1275.46:  So on the one hand is doomsday, AI takes over the world,1275.46 - 1279.94:  everybody loses their jobs, AI goes rogue.1279.94 - 1281.18:  So that's one in the spectrum.1281.18 - 1283.74:  The other end of the spectrum, which I actually think1283.74 - 1287.98:  is more probable, but it's kind of a pipe dream,1287.98 - 1288.82:  but I'll just lay it on.1288.82 - 1291.78:  Anyway, it's this sort of libertarian view of the world1291.78 - 1296.3:  where who knows how Iran's going to play out.1296.3 - 1301.58:  The mullahs, right now they're sort of backed into a corner, but let's assume for a second1301.58 - 1303.54:  that there is peace in the Middle East.1303.54 - 1309.74:  And I know that's somewhat of a long shot, but let's assume that for a second.1309.74 - 1316.86:  And now you've got, maybe not Western democracy other than, you know, quasi-Israel, but you've1316.86 - 1321.22:  got Western capitalism in the Middle East.1321.22 - 1330.14:  So you, and imagine the other end of the spectrum, you know, China, let's assume they maybe relax1330.14 - 1338.3000000000002:  a little bit, open up their markets a little bit, become a little less insulated.1338.3000000000002 - 1343.6200000000001:  So you've got that part of the world cooking, we know China is going to do very, very well1343.6200000000001 - 1353.94:  economically, in so many ways, energy, AI, you know, core infrastructure, rare earths,1353.94 - 1355.38:  you know, name it.1355.38 - 1360.8200000000002:  And then you've got the Middle East now becoming kind of an AI hub with Israel as an innovation1360.8200000000002 - 1363.0200000000002:  center startup nation.1363.02 - 1365.3:  We've got the US exceptionalism.1365.3 - 1372.9:  Imagine a world that's peaceful with less money being spent on war machines, more money1372.9 - 1383.86:  being spent on whether it's the social good, innovation, tech, infrastructure, addressing1383.86 - 1388.54:  poverty, water, for those who don't have potable water.1393.02 - 1402.24:  hope more likely than disaster. And if that occurs, the world, I think, will be a much1402.24 - 1403.24:  better place.1403.24 - 1408.78:  Yeah. I mean, I think the societal change is interesting. I mean, that's why I'm fascinated1408.78 - 1416.3799999999999:  by the robotics way because robotics has been doing a lot of engineering around how to make1416.3799999999999 - 1419.42:  them work, obviously, but you've got robots and manufacturing.1419.42 - 1420.42:  You said that.1420.42 - 1423.7:  Like you pointed out in the beginning, Amazon has been doing robots and they're manufacturing1423.7 - 1427.46:  for a long time, but the idea of robots moving out of, say,1427.46 - 1430.46:  classic manufacturing use cases, notion of digital twins1430.46 - 1435.02:  is moving out of that to all digital physical relationships,1435.02 - 1435.54:  right?1435.54 - 1440.3:  Our digital twin of the cube is one that simple to understand.1440.3 - 1443.22:  And you cubed physically at an event when the event's over,1443.22 - 1446.4199999999998:  you go digital in the cube in the studio.1446.4199999999998 - 1449.98:  And you do just more interviews as if the show never ended.1449.98 - 1452.62:  This idea of having replicas and creating1452.62 - 1455.34:  digital fabric around things is interesting.1455.34 - 1460.78:  And I think AI eats that up for breakfast, you know, and if you say software is eating1460.78 - 1468.54:  the world, okay, you apply that paradigm to anything these days, when you go back, when1468.54 - 1469.54:  did the injuries and write that?1469.54 - 1475.54:  Right when we started the queue roughly, right, around 2010, early last decade.1475.54 - 1481.54:  So apply software eating the world with AI to say you're talking about stablecoins and1481.54 - 1482.84:  robots.1482.84 - 1489.1399999999999:  You now have two hard to crack markets from a transformation standpoint, totally being1489.14 - 1498.3400000000001:  You bring stablecoins in, you get software and AI with decentralized infrastructure.1498.3400000000001 - 1500.94:  Boom, you have a new money system globally.1500.94 - 1504.3000000000002:  Factories, turns into robotics, goes to mainstream.1504.3000000000002 - 1506.5400000000002:  You got your lawnmower with a robot.1506.54 - 1510.74:  You got a humanoid in the house doing chores, all kinds of stuff is going to happen.1510.74 - 1515.1:  So I think the software eating the world memo should be updated.1515.1 - 1520.86:  And I think if I was going to update that memo, I would say AI is eating the world.1520.8600000000001 - 1525.0600000000002:  And if you have things set up, right, with the data, you can crush it.1525.0600000000002 - 1529.16:  You know, if you're a company, you're a user, I mean, just the use cases I'm seeing people1529.16 - 1534.6000000000001:  with Chach EPT and just as a consumer side, you're starting to see the consumer use cases1534.6000000000001 - 1541.2:  start to change. I mean, perplexity pro is pretty damn good. Very good. And Google1541.2 - 1551.28:  search is at risk, you know, so that that intel example could happen to say a Google or an Amazon.1551.28 - 1556.32:  So, you know, hearing Andy Jassy getting behind AI is like a good sign to me that that company1556.32 - 1560.3999999999999:  understands the disruption ahead. And if you don't get in front of it, if you don't run into it,1560.3999999999999 - 1564.8:  run towards it, no way you're going to outrun the AI way.1564.8 - 1571.2:  So I want to go back to, I'm pulling it up here, it was March of 2021 and I wrote about this in1571.2 - 1575.28:  a breaking analysis because it really caught my attention and I thought it was fascinating.1575.28 - 1580.16:  It's when you'll remember this people, I think many in the audience remember, people sold an NFT1580.16 - 1587.12:  for 69 million. It was the first of its kind auction at Christie's. So his name was Mike Winkleman,1587.1200000000001 - 1594.16:  and he's a digital artist, people call him people, the most he ever sold his art for was 100 bucks1594.16 - 1601.2800000000002:  and then his work sold for 69 million at Christie's. It was this, you know, this collage of like the1601.28 - 1604.36:  the first 5,000 days is called.1604.36 - 1607.28:  And so it made him one of the most valuable,1607.28 - 1609.68:  three most valuable living artists.1609.68 - 1611.2:  All right, and so at the time I was like,1611.2 - 1613.24:  people are like, that's crazy, that makes no sense.1613.24 - 1617.08:  But what it said to me is that the physical world1617.08 - 1619.1200000000001:  is gonna get tokenized.1619.1200000000001 - 1621.64:  And then, you know, we, nobody, after that,1621.64 - 1624.32:  it was a lot of hype around it and it kind of died off.1624.32 - 1626.72:  But that whole thing is coming back with stablecoins1626.72 - 1631.72:  and RWA real-world assets being digitized and tokenized1632.04 - 1636.76:  and basically backing value for things like stablecoins.1636.76 - 1639.1599999999999:  I mean, stablecoins are backed by obviously, you know,1639.16 - 1644.0800000000002:  dollars, but they can be backed by physical access, I think eventually they'll be backed1644.0800000000002 - 1645.0800000000002:  by real estate.1645.0800000000002 - 1648.24:  Oh, that's more complicated because there's titles and stuff like that.1648.24 - 1650.16:  So that's probably the end of the chain.1650.16 - 1657.92:  Nonetheless, virtually anything can be tokenized and that physical world is becoming digitized.1657.92 - 1658.92:  Why is that important?1658.92 - 1665.16:  It's important because it just makes trading a lot easier, a lot faster.1665.16 - 1670.44:  today. There's a lot of complex, you know, middle infrastructure, middle men, if you will,1671.8000000000002 - 1676.0400000000002:  that can go away. Now that maybe there will always be some kind of trusted third party source1676.04 - 1681.6399999999999:  in some way, shape, or form. People will maybe prefer that. But you and I, John and Dave,1681.6399999999999 - 1690.12:  can have a digital contract and a smart contract when we don't need anything in the middle.1690.1200000000001 - 1694.24:  and we can affect trades virtually instantaneously.1694.24 - 1697.24:  We don't have to wait three days for an ACH to go through.1697.24 - 1700.96:  And so imagine the entire physical world1700.96 - 1702.72:  being digitized and tokenized,1702.72 - 1705.72:  and imagine trading being a lot more facile,1705.72 - 1711.08:  a lot more productive, a lot less red tape, things being done a lot faster, and being1711.08 - 1716.08:  able to collect a portfolio of assets and trade it, make it more fungible.1716.08 - 1720.52:  It just opens up a whole new world of possibilities, and I think this is happening, right before1720.52 - 1725.28:  our eyes, and people was kind of the first example of that, which, and again, everybody1725.28 - 1729.4:  thought it was, oh, it was bullshit, it was just, you know, a fad, it's not, it's actually1729.4 - 1734.92:  happening and there's major infrastructure and protocols being built around this.1734.92 - 1739.3200000000002:  And there's a whole new, essentially, internet infrastructure being built beyond what was built1739.3200000000002 - 1744.3600000000001:  30, 40, 50 years ago with protocols out of academia and government.1744.3600000000001 - 1750.8400000000001:  Yeah. I mean, protocols always drive the change. That's why I love the MCP stuff going on with1750.8400000000001 - 1760.0400000000002:  agents. The protocols around layer one, chains, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and layer two for Ethereum,1760.04 - 1764.52:  and just the programmable money world that we've been in1764.52 - 1766.48:  for almost a decade, covering it,1766.48 - 1770.6:  and then practitioners for, you know, since 2016,1770.6 - 1773.52:  I think, I mean, it's our first token project1773.52 - 1776.76:  for our platform, but I mean, it's time.1776.76 - 1779.16:  Right now, it's game time and all the things are lining up.1779.16 - 1783.6:  You're starting to see FinTech become mainstream.1783.6 - 1788.6:  You see commerce, any kind of e-commerce is not digital.1788.6000000000001 - 1792.2800000000002:  I think it's gonna be a massive boom for the economy.1793.2 - 1796.5200000000002:  It's funny, I was just getting texts while you were talking,1796.5200000000002 - 1798.16:  not interrupt, but the chain of thought,1798.16 - 1801.92:  but Amazon's confirming we're gonna be at AWS Summit1803.4800000000002 - 1805.16:  in two weeks in New York.1818.6000000000001 - 1822.6000000000001:  On September 16th, we're going to go down to the Javits.1822.6000000000001 - 1825.4:  Remember how long the lines were there to get in?1825.4 - 1826.4:  It's a free event.1826.4 - 1829.68:  Oh, we should tell the story because it was, what was that, John?1829.68 - 1833.28:  It was a 2021 or 2022.1833.28 - 1835.0800000000002:  It's 2022.1835.0800000000002 - 1836.5800000000002:  So what happened was 20211836.5800000000002 - 1839.0800000000002:  when we came up with a super cloud concept,1839.0800000000002 - 1841.72:  AWS re-invent went down.1841.72 - 1844.88:  So our first physical show was that summer,1844.88 - 1851.88:  July of 2021 in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress with Cloud City.1851.88 - 1854.0400000000002:  There was nobody there, like 10,000 people there.1854.0400000000002 - 1856.5200000000002:  We were in the center of Cloud City.1856.5200000000002 - 1860.5200000000002:  Danielle Royston with Telco DR took over MWC.1860.52 - 1864.16:  That was the first show we did in July of 2021,1864.16 - 1866.42:  after being locked down for a year.1866.42 - 1868.92:  John Bon Jovi flew in, he was super happy.1868.92 - 1871.24:  He's like, thank you guys for having me, blah, blah, blah.1871.24 - 1874.5:  That was awesome, even though it was weird.1874.5 - 1877.26:  And then the next big event,1877.26 - 1880.02:  you remember AWS canceled, reinforced that.1880.02 - 1881.26:  You were supposed to be in Houston.1881.26 - 1883.7:  They canceled it because it was still kind of funky,1883.7 - 1885.82:  but they did reinvent.1885.82 - 1888.1399999999999:  And that was in November, December.1888.1399999999999 - 1890.02:  And we wrote, that's when we wrote the super cloud.1890.02 - 1891.62:  We saw the ecosystem forming.1891.62 - 1893.86:  And then Amacron hit.1893.86 - 1895.9399999999998:  And everything's shut down again, you remember?1895.9399999999998 - 1896.78:  Yes.1896.78 - 1899.94:  And then later in 2022, that summer,1899.94 - 1902.66:  they did AWS NYC Summit.1902.66 - 1904.86:  And there were so many frickin' people1904.86 - 1906.94:  dying to get into the Javits.1906.94 - 1909.74:  And it was such a bottleneck, and they couldn't handle it.1909.74 - 1911.7:  and the people, the lines were getting longer,1911.7 - 1914.48:  people were complaining, it was way past the show,1914.48 - 1916.94:  time starting, you know, people hadn't traveled,1916.94 - 1920.34:  everybody was excited, finally, the security just said,1920.34 - 1922.78:  fuck it, and they opened all the doors1922.78 - 1924.46:  and everybody just poured in.1924.46 - 1925.58:  You remember that scene?1925.58 - 1926.42:  It was crazy.1926.42 - 1927.7:  It was like a Tokyo subway.1927.7 - 1929.06:  I'd never seen anything like it.1929.06 - 1930.82:  They just dam their torpedoes.1930.82 - 1932.3:  This, come on in.1932.3 - 1935.74:  And there was like 30, 40,000 people that was supposed to be1935.74 - 1937.26:  only 10,000 people.1937.26 - 1938.5:  Everybody just showed up.1938.5 - 1940.34:  It was crazy.1940.34 - 1941.18:  Absolutely crazy.1941.18 - 1942.78:  It was a stampede, basically.1942.78 - 1944.4199999999998:  It was a stampede.1944.42 - 1948.66:  I remember thinking, wow, this is insane.1948.66 - 1949.5:  No security.1949.5 - 1951.6200000000001:  I mean, it was just nuts.1951.6200000000001 - 1954.46:  Never see anything like it in the United States.1954.46 - 1957.94:  We'll see what is gonna be there this year.1957.94 - 1960.8200000000002:  Usually there's always protests in New York.1960.82 - 1966.1399999999999:  And also next week, Ray's Summit, the Ray's like raising money, not Ray's Summit to be1966.1399999999999 - 1971.06:  confused with Ray, R-A-Y-S, which is any scales event.1971.06 - 1975.1399999999999:  And our AI SE, right, is an AI angle, of course.1975.1399999999999 - 1980.1399999999999:  There's gonna be 21 of our companies that sponsor us.1980.5 - 1983.74:  SAP, UiPath, Page of Duty, AWS, Snowflake,1983.74 - 1987.78:  Cohere, Logic Monitor, Red Hat, DDN, Salesforce, Zendes,1987.78 - 1991.06:  Palo Alto, Google Service Now, Snyk, NetApp, Databricks,1991.06 - 1992.86:  Nutanix, Super Micro, Cerebrous,1992.86 - 1995.02:  Marantis, and Palo Alto Networks.2013.74 - 2016.02:  I'm gonna, we got all the alum up there.2016.02 - 2017.66:  I was just going to go there with one camera2017.66 - 2020.7:  and do a little pod casting, do four interviews,2020.7 - 2022.82:  but I'm going to have two full days.2022.82 - 2023.66:  Yeah.2023.66 - 2024.74:  I mean, it's going to be packed.2024.74 - 2026.5:  And these are just the names that we know.2026.5 - 2028.3400000000001:  It's like, I got my emails blowing up2028.3400000000001 - 2030.5400000000002:  with all these hot European companies.2030.5400000000002 - 2033.18:  So this is an international event.2033.18 - 2034.9:  It's like human ex for Europe.2053.66 - 2057.46:  to get some scoops is gonna be a grinding cube event.2057.46 - 2058.8999999999996:  We're gonna have epic coverage.2058.8999999999996 - 2060.94:  NYC wire is gonna be there.2060.94 - 2064.7:  The Brian Bauman and the NYC team is gonna be there.2064.7 - 2066.1:  Vice chairman of the NYC.2066.1 - 2070.62:  So it's going to be, it's really, I mean, engaging event.2070.62 - 2071.86:  I can't wait, actually.2071.86 - 2074.46:  So the only bummer is I got to fly out on the 4th of July2074.46 - 2077.66:  weekend, but yeah, it's going to be interesting2077.66 - 2083.5:  see how that plays out. But these AI conferences are attracting everybody. And this is like what2083.5 - 2090.62:  HumanEx didn't do. They were more mainstream. This is enterprise, this infrastructure panels.2090.62 - 2097.42:  I'm hosting with UiPath CEO, RPA, the building blocks for agentics, so interesting to hear2097.42 - 2101.98:  the update from UiPath. I mean, you're covering the event. I think you're going to do the UiPath2101.98 - 2107.66:  event this year, right? Again? Oh, yeah. I've done that UI path since they did their second one.2107.66 - 2112.78:  I was at forward two. I think this is now that I think they stopped counting. This is like forward2112.78 - 2117.1000000000004:  would be forward seven or eight. Of course, they missed a couple during COVID.2118.7000000000003 - 2123.26:  UiPath, yeah, UiPath's really interesting, right? Because they were a rocket ship. They2123.26 - 2125.6600000000003:  they completely disrupted RPA.2125.6600000000003 - 2127.78:  And then they pivoted away from RPA2127.78 - 2131.7000000000003:  into enterprise automation and hyper automation2131.7000000000003 - 2133.1800000000003:  was a term that they used.2134.38 - 2136.26:  And then now they're sort of doubling down.2136.26 - 2138.5400000000004:  It reminds me of Veeam a little bit2138.54 - 2142.1:  Veeam was like, they didn't run away from backup.2142.1 - 2143.42:  They said, you know, it's actually,2143.42 - 2144.54:  that's where it all starts.2144.54 - 2146.02:  Backup, you gotta back it up first.2146.02 - 2146.86:  And then you can do-2146.86 - 2150.38:  They stick to the position and they didn't try to like be fashionable and jump on the2150.38 - 2152.46:  wave shining a new toy trend.2152.46 - 2155.42:  Well, and so now there, but their argument is quite interesting.2155.42 - 2157.7400000000002:  It's like, look, RPA gives you advantages.2157.7400000000002 - 2162.78:  If you have that RPA plumbing that's trusted, it's governed, and you can bring a gentic2162.78 - 2164.5200000000004:  on top of that.2164.5200000000004 - 2169.0200000000004:  Because a gentic is a fricking nightmare from a security and a governance standpoint.2169.02 - 2174.94:  argument is we've got that governance layer covered. We're going to be the agent orchestration2174.94 - 2179.9:  layer and we're going to lean on our RPA roots and all the good work that you guys have done and2179.9 - 2188.78:  in that plumbing to give you safe agentic. I think it's a good strategy. The stock market,2188.78 - 2193.1800000000003:  the analysts haven't bought it because it hasn't translated into payments. They had some2193.18 - 2201.7799999999997:  They had, they brought in Rob, Rob Enslin, it was a senior guy, go to market guy, came2201.7799999999997 - 2209.58:  from SAP, I think he missed the numbers and he ended up resigning, as my insiders told2209.58 - 2210.8199999999997:  I mean, we didn't want him to resign.2210.8199999999997 - 2212.38:  We actually wanted him to stay,2212.38 - 2214.94:  but I think he felt like he had over-rotated.2214.94 - 2218.18:  So Daniel Deniz took the company back under his wings.2218.18 - 2221.18:  You know, he's a hardcore product visionary.2221.18 - 2224.54:  you'll meet him. I don't think, I don't know if you've ever met him. He's a, he's a character.2224.54 - 2230.7:  He's kind of a really, he's a really cool guy. And, and I think you really enjoy him. He's just2230.7000000000003 - 2236.3:  really thoughtful. And you can ask him anything. And he's got, he thinks about it and he gives2236.3 - 2242.2200000000003:  you an answer. And you know, he built this rocket ship, it ran up to $38 billion valuation.2242.2200000000003 - 2245.0600000000004:  It's probably now trading in the $10 billion range.2245.0600000000004 - 2247.0600000000004:  So they took on some pain,2247.0600000000004 - 2249.7400000000002:  but a lot of people made a lot of money at that company.2249.7400000000002 - 2253.5000000000005:  But I mean, I think RPA is not old hat.2253.5 - 2260.82:  I think it's the process work that they do is easy pivot or switch to AI because they2260.82 - 2263.06:  have the work done, right?2263.06 - 2271.9:  So if they can kind of just shed the negative branding around RPA's, yesterday's news to2271.9 - 2274.2000000000003:  It's really the setup for AI.2274.2000000000003 - 2275.56:  That's a positioning I like,2275.56 - 2278.08:  because if you look at all the successful AI stuff2278.08 - 2280.4:  we're covering, the ones that are selling at it2280.4 - 2282.76:  are, have done the prep work.2282.76 - 2285.0400000000004:  like the data cleaning and all the data management,2285.0400000000004 - 2288.0800000000004:  all the process, understanding the processes,2288.0800000000004 - 2289.84:  huge advantage.2289.84 - 2291.7200000000003:  And the ones that don't do that don't scale.2291.7200000000003 - 2292.88:  And it's a scale you're up right now.2292.88 - 2296.92:  So I'm dying to know what you think after you talk to Daniel and I think that's a good2296.92 - 2300.96:  insight, especially for somebody who hasn't, you know, you've not been deep into this2300.96 - 2305.7200000000003:  space. But, you know, I mean, you understand it. But, you know, I've covered it for years2305.7200000000003 - 2309.68:  when Bobby Patrick turned, I followed Bobby. You remember Bobby Patrick, of course, from2309.68 - 2318.02:  HP, they had, HP had the kick ass cloud member Bill Hill, Bobby Patrick, who was the other2318.02 - 2319.9199999999996:  gal they had involved in?2319.9199999999996 - 2320.9199999999996:  Sargalye.2320.9199999999996 - 2321.9199999999996:  Sargalye was involved.2321.92 - 2326.48:  And they had a kick-ass cloud team that they put together,2326.48 - 2329.96:  and then they just didn't stick with it2329.96 - 2332.64:  and just didn't make sense, I guess, to stick with.2332.64 - 2333.64:  And they didn't commit.2333.64 - 2336.4:  I mean, they were basically, it's like Intel,2336.4 - 2338.98:  it's like when Diane Bryant was on theCUBE2338.98 - 2341.6:  in our Palo Alto studio and talking about the Intel,2341.6 - 2344.08:  it's like if you just waited a little bit longer,2344.08 - 2348.4:  of these things would have popped, right? So like, they just gave up too early, like probably2348.4 - 2353.12:  internal politics and debates. But, you know, you got to go all and burn the boats, go all2353.12 - 2359.8399999999997:  they gave up on AI and yeah so but yeah I mean so that that was they had a really good team2359.8399999999997 - 2363.8399999999997:  but anyway that's when I first started following IPA I was kind of following Bobby Patrick around2363.84 - 2371.36:  who's a really strong marketing guy. I think, I think he is, I don't know if he's left UiPath.2371.36 - 2376.7200000000003:  I think he announced he's leaving and I think he's out. Somebody should pick him up.2376.7200000000003 - 2383.6400000000003:  I like Bobby Patrick. He's good marketer. He's solid. I think his, I think his time at2383.6400000000003 - 2391.6000000000004:  you, I know he announced it. He may still be there just winding things down. Yeah, he's2391.6 - 2394.44:  He's still there, but he announced he's leaving.2394.44 - 2399.68:  So, back to the raise summit to add a point to that, because I think it's important to2399.68 - 2402.72:  notice snowflakes there, but no Databricks.2402.7200000000003 - 2405.0000000000005:  Benoit will be speaking.2405.0000000000005 - 2406.28:  Databricks isn't showing up.2406.28 - 2408.4:  So I think this is really interesting signal.2408.4 - 2409.82:  DDN's going to be there.2411.1200000000003 - 2414.0800000000004:  Founder, so Benoit going to come on theCUBE.2414.08 - 2415.84:  I haven't put the schedule together.2415.84 - 2417.12:  I'm working on that tonight and tomorrow.2417.12 - 2418.6:  So I'll have it finalized tomorrow2418.6 - 2420.3199999999997:  and get it out to the team over the race.2420.3199999999997 - 2422.2:  So they got a great lineup.2422.2 - 2424.16:  They got Founders Fund.2424.16 - 2429.16:  They got, like I said, they have an AI infrastructure group.2429.2999999999997 - 2432.3999999999996:  Chase from Caruso is gonna be there, Caruso.2432.3999999999996 - 2433.8399999999997:  And then you got,2433.8399999999997 - 2435.04:  Oh, Chase Lockmill will be there.2435.04 - 2436.44:  We just had him on.2436.44 - 2438.24:  He's awesome.2454.16 - 2455.96:  I'm coming on, he's confirmed by the way.2455.96 - 2457.92:  Nikesh from Palo Alto Networks.2457.92 - 2460.44:  If you've ever interviewed him before.2460.44 - 2462.52:  I've never interviewed him before.2462.52 - 2464.44:  He's awesome.2464.44 - 2466.68:  I love that guy, he's another one.2466.68 - 2468.62:  you can ask him anything.2468.62 - 2469.72:  And he'll just...2469.72 - 2473.04:  And Austin Wagonfeld is gonna be there from Google Cloud.2473.04 - 2474.04:  Yes, he's not.2474.04 - 2476.52:  Amid Savory from Service Now Day.2476.52 - 2480.12:  Yeah, an old friend of Mitt, that's great.2480.12 - 2482.56:  George Kurian, NetApp,2482.56 - 2486.08:  Ori from AI21 Labs, he's gonna be there.2487.68 - 2490.12:  Just some really good names.2490.12 - 2492.7999999999997:  Oh no, Databricks is there, on my bat, Naveen Rao.2493.7999999999997 - 2494.96:  I gotta add that to my list.2494.96 - 2496.16:  Yeah, put him on.2496.16 - 2497.44:  I definitely want to get.2497.44 - 2500.44:  And Rajee from Nutanix.2500.44 - 2501.28:  Really?2501.28 - 2502.8:  Yes.2502.8 - 2505.2:  Super micro CEO is going to be there.2505.2 - 2507.0:  He's going to come on the cube.2507.0 - 2509.0:  I'm gonna ask you about how his business is going.2509.0 - 2510.8:  He must be, they had that little accounting problem,2510.8 - 2514.04:  but then remember, they moved a lot of boxes.2514.04 - 2516.0:  They must have a lot of action going on.2516.0 - 2517.28:  Sequoia is going to be there.2517.28 - 2519.04:  So you got a lot of big VCs.2521.04 - 2524.04:  Yeah, it's going to get Cerybrus and Andrew Feldman.2524.04 - 2526.08:  He's going to come on the cube.2526.08 - 2527.28:  Yeah, it should be fun, Dave.2527.28 - 2529.8:  should be fun.

And yeah, so I'll be around.2548.92 - 2553.92:  We think about this Sam Altman memo missionaries beat mercenaries.2553.92 - 2563.92:  He's calling open AI missionaries, and I think he's calling meta mercenaries because Zuckerberg2563.92 - 2569.48:  has multiple times, poached people, buys companies, takes them off the table, throws2569.48 - 2571.04:  money around like it's nobody's business.2571.04 - 2578.4:  I keep going back to the January 2023 breaking analysis that you, Sarbjit, and I did, and2578.4 - 2583.92:  the premise was, and you took the other side, the premise was open AI won't be able to2583.92 - 2586.56:  to maintain its first mover advantage.2586.56 - 2589.16:  And the more I watch Altman,2589.16 - 2594.16:  the more I think your scenario is the correct one.2594.2000000000003 - 2597.52:  And really because I think Sam Altman2597.52 - 2602.0:  is such an important figure in this next generation.2602.0 - 2604.44:  He's weathered the attempt,2613.92 - 2619.28:  Richard Microsoft basically trying to hire everybody away, including him.2619.28 - 2624.32:  He's weathered Elon so far anyway of trying to take him out.2624.32 - 2629.7200000000003:  And he just keeps creating, you know, so much buzz, so much value.2629.7200000000003 - 2633.2400000000002:  And I think as a lab, they are still in the forefront.2633.2400000000002 - 2636.7200000000003:  And so I think that, you know,2636.7200000000003 - 2640.44:  Sam Altman is the Steve Jobs of, of, of his era.2640.44 - 2641.76:  I really believe that.2641.76 - 2643.6400000000003:  I think they could be the first trillion dollar2643.64 - 2650.08:  private company yeah I think you're right I think I think they're the fifth2650.08 - 2655.2:  largest website most traffic website now on the planet I think they will in my2655.2 - 2661.7999999999997:  opinion be the most traffic website I think they will surpass what's Google2661.8 - 2666.7200000000003:  number one right now, right? I think eventually they'll ask you2666.7200000000003 - 2669.6000000000004:  those stats. I mean, that's absolutely good one.2671.84 - 2673.2000000000003:  Bias and Sancers.2674.4 - 2675.5600000000004:  Well, let's ask Claude.2678.6000000000004 - 2680.6000000000004:  Look, ask all of them, see what they say.2680.6 - 2691.6:  All right. I'll ask Jim and I first. That's amazing. So yeah. So I anyway, I think that's2691.6 - 2696.64:  what I think. I think, you know, when Sam Altman speaks, you got to listen to him. Google2696.64 - 2708.52:  number one. Yeah, for sure. So, YouTube is the second. Google gets 105 billion monthly2708.52 - 2716.56:  visits. YouTube is second most visited with 47 billion. I mean, what do you think about2716.56 - 2721.36:  Google. I mean, a lot of people are down on Google. I'm actually not down on Google.2724.24 - 2729.36:  I don't, I think they're smart enough to, you know, weather this storm. I think they,2729.36 - 2733.84:  I wish they would stop screwing up my user experience2733.84 - 2737.1600000000003:  with their injecting AI into me,2737.1600000000003 - 2739.04:  but I think they'll figure that out.2739.04 - 2742.0:  But they just, they get such good data.2742.0 - 2745.7200000000003:  And their tech is so strong.2745.7200000000003 - 2747.96:  And I see them coming on the data.2747.96 - 2753.4800000000005:  I see their AI business and their cloud business as good momentum.2753.4800000000005 - 2760.84:  And like Microsoft before them, I think they just have enough of a cash cow that it'll2760.84 - 2767.56:  buy them time to not screw it up. And I think they're smart people. And the cloud2767.56 - 2773.8:  flares in the book news today, they saw that paper with a new pricing model, a paper paper2773.8 - 2778.36:  crawl. That's interesting, right? I think the pricing, I think the SaaS pricing model,2779.0800000000004 - 2783.0800000000004:  really, that Salesforce is popularized, and everybody else serves now,2783.0800000000004 - 2786.92:  anybody else is going to follow that. I think that's going to come under fire2786.92 - 2794.52:  in a big way. Price per crawl, that's interesting. Consumption is a derivative, I think, of price2794.52 - 2801.8:  per seat in a way. It's just a different model, but it's still lock in, commit to X amount.2801.8 - 2806.0:  They're going to let sites charge AI crawlers per crawl.2806.0 - 2810.1200000000003:  New sites using Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers by default.2810.1200000000003 - 2813.6400000000003:  Nice. Welcome to AI optimization.2813.6400000000003 - 2814.4:  Cloudflare.2814.4 - 2816.12:  of search engine optimization.2816.12 - 2819.44:  Now we have, that's a ball or move by CloudFlare.2819.44 - 2821.2400000000002:  Matthew's got some balls, doesn't he?2821.2400000000002 - 2823.8:  He's a true disruptor.2823.8 - 2824.88:  I like him a lot.2824.88 - 2826.48:  He's very underrated.2826.48 - 2828.84:  Cloudflare team is very strong with big fan.2828.84 - 2830.16:  I'm a big fan of what they do.2830.16 - 2833.12:  So I have to weigh the way they execute.2833.12 - 2834.48:  The founders are cool.2834.48 - 2837.32:  They're smart and they provide a great service.2837.32 - 2838.56:  This is just a great one for people2838.56 - 2841.32:  who don't want to protect their sites from AI,2841.32 - 2844.2000000000003:  or at least monetize.2844.2000000000003 - 2847.52:  Right now, they're being distilled away the value.2847.52 - 2852.52:  So you start to see AI kind of doing some things2852.52 - 2858.9:  AI kind of doing some things that, you know, I was unchecked, right? I was talking to2858.9 - 2864.22:  a, to some folks in New York and the joke was that the conversation was turned to AI and2864.2200000000003 - 2866.9:  It quickly turned into the story that was going around2866.9 - 2871.9:  around that guy who asked Chachi PT to marry him.2872.5000000000005 - 2874.0200000000004:  And he's married, by the way.2874.0200000000004 - 2874.86:  The wife knows about it.2874.86 - 2877.32:  It's like, and Chachi said, no.2877.32 - 2882.7200000000003:  And then when chat GBT lost its memory, he had a breakdown.2882.7200000000003 - 2884.7200000000003:  Like I have to re-enter everything in.2884.7200000000003 - 2888.84:  He had a relationship with the AI and then it lost its memory.2888.84 - 2890.1600000000003:  The GPU must have failed.2890.1600000000003 - 2891.6000000000004:  It didn't keep the tokens alive.2891.6 - 2894.6:  the context window got too big and crashed,2894.6 - 2896.52:  and he was freaking out like,2896.52 - 2897.96:  you forgot who I was.2900.12 - 2904.68:  It was like, it's an example of basically2904.68 - 2908.96:  the human AI relationship is gonna be very interesting.2908.96 - 2912.7200000000003:  And when robots come in, I think it's going to be much faster.2912.7200000000003 - 2918.2400000000002:  Most people think, like, 2050, that the population of robots2918.2400000000002 - 2919.8:  will surpass humans.2919.8 - 2921.92:  I think it's going to be within the next decade.2921.92 - 2924.82:  So, you know, once the pennant rates the home,2924.82 - 2926.7400000000002:  you know, whatever you call a robot,2926.7400000000002 - 2927.98:  I mean, I wouldn't call the trash can2927.98 - 2930.1:  that the nest found is doing a robot yet,2930.1 - 2932.7000000000003:  but or even the fork is cleaner.2932.7000000000003 - 2936.4600000000005:  Well, I think there's a spectrum of robots.2936.4600000000005 - 2939.78:  There's the ones that were shown in that Amazon article.2939.78 - 2941.38:  They basically do this.2941.38 - 2943.42:  They pick up a package, they drop it,2943.42 - 2944.5000000000005:  they pick up another package,2944.5 - 2949.26:  They're able to visualize where the packages are,2949.26 - 2951.58:  they pick them up with their suction cups or whatever,2951.58 - 2952.42:  they drop them off.2952.42 - 2954.9:  Okay, there's a lot of those robots,2954.9 - 2957.06:  but as far as humanoid robots,2957.06 - 2959.38:  I do think it's gonna take a lot longer2959.38 - 2961.9:  to master and perfect.2961.9 - 2964.7999999999997:  I am, maybe it's not 2050.2964.7999999999997 - 2965.64:  But I think it's-2965.64 - 2967.46:  I mean, I was talking to some robot makers2967.46 - 2971.54:  that came on theCUBE during this focus series we're doing.2971.54 - 2973.06:  And some of them are really doing well.2973.06 - 2977.02:  For instance, like this little robot that's on wheels,2977.02 - 2980.54:  basically helps the kids, some people's kids learn languages2980.54 - 2983.46:  or keeps people company, lonely, elderly people.2983.46 - 2987.1:  So there's a, there's a, kind of a pet angle here, right?2987.1 - 2989.62:  Like, hey, you know, keep me company and learn.2989.62 - 2991.7:  Like, so, you know, just imagine,2991.7000000000003 - 2996.9:  that's why John Ivy sold that company because imagine a device rather than getting answers2996.9 - 3004.5000000000005:  back and prompts that's always on like your watch or your phone that actually is working3004.5000000000005 - 3011.78:  and navigating the world with you. That's not far out, it's here. So just rendering that into a robot3011.78 - 3016.78:  in the personal side, I see as doable.3017.2200000000003 - 3018.46:  So, I mean, I'm bullish on it.3018.46 - 3020.2200000000003:  I think it's gonna happen sooner than later.3020.2200000000003 - 3022.86:  The humanoid thing walking around like the Jetsons,3022.86 - 3025.0600000000004:  that old show that most people don't know3025.06 - 3026.9:  they're over unless they're in their fifties.3026.9 - 3031.06:  But, you know, that cartoon, you got flying cars,3031.06 - 3035.0:  you got, you know, the robot maids, you know,3036.54 - 3040.7:  that fantasy world is coming.3040.7 - 3042.24:  So, we'll see.3042.2400000000002 - 3043.7200000000003:  All right Dave, well, I gotta say,3043.7200000000003 - 3045.1200000000003:  we've got a very busy summer.3045.1200000000003 - 3047.6400000000003:  Usually it's gear up for the second half of the year,3047.6400000000003 - 3051.1200000000003:  cube season, but a lot of action happening.3051.1200000000003 - 3054.1600000000003:  Silicon angle traffic's going great.3054.16 - 3057.72:  the NYSC studio will be built out over the summer3057.72 - 3058.74:  in the new look.3060.48 - 3062.56:  And so, so SiliconANGLE traffic's going great.3062.56 - 3064.2799999999997:  So was theCUBE.net, by the way,3064.2799999999997 - 3065.68:  I was on similar web the other day,3065.6800000000003 - 3067.2400000000002:  looking at my dashboard.3067.2400000000002 - 3069.76:  And our Google Analytics are plugged in3069.76 - 3073.92:  to siliconangle.com or from siliconangle.com3073.92 - 3075.92:  and the cube.net are plugged into similar web.3075.92 - 3078.0000000000005:  I noticed the cube research wasn't.3078.0000000000005 - 3080.4800000000005:  And when I compare the cube research numbers3080.48 - 3083.76:  on similar web to our actual Google Analytics,3083.76 - 3087.52:  it's way higher than similar web shows.3087.52 - 3089.16:  So I emailed our web team and said,3089.16 - 3092.76:  guys, plug our Google Analytics into similar web3092.76 - 3096.6:  because you're like one fifth of our actual traffic3096.6 - 3098.52:  in theCUBE research, which the analyst team3098.52 - 3100.12:  has been cranking out research lately.3100.12 - 3102.04:  So we got to get that done too.3102.04 - 3105.0:  So we can, as people always asking us,3105.0 - 3105.8399999999997:  well, how big's your audience?3105.84 - 3107.28:  Go to similar web and check it out.3107.28 - 3109.84:  Compare us to the one point of the competition.3109.84 - 3112.6400000000003:  Last month, last month, 1.3 million.3114.2000000000003 - 3118.04:  The year we did visits, that's a lot.3118.04 - 3121.08:  For us, we're not trying to drive traffic to it.3135.84 - 3140.84:  customers, but guess we had on theCUBE potential customer,3140.84 - 3144.36:  but an end user customer posted their interview on LinkedIn.3144.36 - 3149.36:  It had like 300 likes, like 20 reposts, 100 comments.3150.8 - 3154.52:  And those comments, those are repostings.3154.52 - 3156.34:  That's distribution, right?3156.34 - 3161.22:  So that's not really factored in into a lot of this depth3161.22 - 3162.78:  of the network effect.3162.78 - 3164.74:  So it's really interesting.3164.74 - 3167.94:  So again, we made that bet years ago, as you know,3167.94 - 3171.88:  not news to us, but I'd love to somehow get linked in,3171.88 - 3173.8:  figure out how perplexity gets that protocol.3173.8 - 3175.36:  So anyone who's listening to this podcast3175.36 - 3179.2000000000003:  and knows how to get access to some sort of API3179.2000000000003 - 3184.2000000000003:  to actually measure, I mean, phenomenal.3184.2000000000003 - 3187.32:  been on the ocean. I should check it out more deeply. But3188.2000000000003 - 3192.6000000000004:  all right, Dave. Well, great to be in your neck of the woods. I'm actually at my sisters in3192.6 - 3197.96:  Weston, like I said, I should have drove to the office, but the car doesn't have AC broken.3199.96 - 3207.0:  Uber, dude. It's five o'clock on the west coast. I've got a couple more hours to get3207.0 - 3210.24:  grinding. So, and I got to put this schedule together for3210.24 - 3212.32:  Ray's. Ray's is going to be a great conference. Everyone's3212.32 - 3216.12:  going to be there. It's going to be essentially an3216.12 - 3222.32:  international kind of tech Wall Street, Silicon Valley, New3222.32 - 3227.52:  New York, Texan, going to Paris and integrating it with the European.3227.52 - 3231.0:  So you have a new wardrobe, I noticed.3231.2000000000003 - 3233.88:  I'm going to the mall to pick up a couple new suits.3234.04 - 3234.6400000000003:  I'm back.3235.84 - 3236.44:  All right.3236.44 - 3241.1:  Lost a few pounds lost a few LBs.
